  <h1 class="title-os"> The story behind our name </h1>


<div class="words">
  <p class="os"> 
    Our name MukVeg is inspired by the trend called Mukbang. 
    They are videos, especially ones that is live-streamed, that feature a person eating a large quantity of food and addressing an audience.

    The word mukbang (먹방; meokbang) is a combination of the Korean words for "eating" (먹는; meongneun) and "broadcast" (방송; bangsong). So our brand name translates to "eat veg" which, is what we promote here.
