    Meat – or more specifically, ‘industrial meat’ is bad for the environment.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong> It causes deforestation and forest fires</strong>
    <br>
    Industrial meat is the single biggest cause of deforestation.In Brazil, farmers are deliberately setting forest fires to clear space for cattle ranching and to grow industrial animal feed
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>It causes climate change.</strong>
    <br>
    The climate impact of meat is roughly equivalent to all the driving and flying of every car, truck and plane in the world. When forests are destroyed, billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide are released into the atmosphere, comnbined with rotting fallen trees which release further emissions.
    <br>
    <strong>Greenhouse gases.</strong>
    <br>
    Methane - the biggest contributors of greenhouse gases are cows, responsible for 65 percent of the livestock sector’s emissions.
    Carbon emissions associated with a single gram of protein from beef are at least 7.5 times higher than those associated with a gram of protein from plant sources.

      <strong>It supports your immune system.</strong>
      <br>
      Plants have essential nutrients that you cannot get from other foods. The vitamins and minerals, phytochemicals and antioxidants in plants help keep your cells healthy and your body in balance so that your immune system can function at its best.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Helps reduce the risk of obesity and inflammation.</strong>
      <br>
      If you are overweight or obese, your risk is higher for 12 different types of cancer including colorectal, post-menopausal breast, uterine, esophageal, kidney and pancreatic cancers.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Nutrient density</strong>
      <br>
      Veggies have more vitamins and minerals per calorie than meat and animal products do. Beyond the vitamins, plant-based diets are richer in fiber, contain more natural sugars and provide healthier fats.

    <strong>Destroying biodiversity</strong>
    <br>
    By clearing forests, destroying habitats and using toxic pesticides to grow animal food has lead to species nearing extinction.The huge abundance and variety of the natural world (sometimes called biodiversity) is essential for food, clean water and medicines.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Industrial fishing.</strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    This has had a catastrophic impact on the ocean with discarded fishing nets alone making up roughly 46 percent of the infamous Great Pacific Garbage Patch. The industry is also depleting our oceans of marine life, including mammals, killing more than 300,000 dolphins and whales annually as by catch.

    <div class="fullcap">Water
      <br>
      <br>
      Per ton of product, animal products generally have a larger water footprint than crop products.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>The water footprint per gram of protein for milk, eggs and chicken meat is about 1.5 times larger than for pulses.</strong>
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Meat contributes to the global water crisis</strong>
      <br>
      <br>
       In total, meat production demands almost <strong>2,300 trillion tons of water </strong> every year.
       <br>

       The groundwater level is falling dramatically in countries such as China, India and the USA. This is serious - especially as these three countries produce half of the world’s food.

     <div class="fullcap">Land
      <br>
      <br>
      Beef makes up 24% of the world's meat consumption, yet requires 30 million square kilometres of land to produce.
      <br>
      <strong>If everyone ate a plant-based diet, we’d need 75% less farmland than we use today.</strong>
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Overexploitation of grasslands.</strong>
      <br>
      <br>
      Intensive meat farming can lead to areas becoming arid. 

      <strong>Land grabbing.</strong>
      <br>
      <br>
       Indigenous People and traditional communities – like the geraizeira in Brazil have had their land stolen from them for agriculture, forestry etc.
